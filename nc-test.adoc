== Simple `syslog` test via netcat

The simplest way to check if logs are being sent is using `nc` (netcat)
utility that usually comes preinstalled on Linux or macOS systems.

To send a log you can type following command (replacing `IP` with any IP
address and `CUSTOMER_TOKEN` with the value that was provided to you in
the confirmation email):

....
$ echo "[IP][CUSTOMER_TOKEN] Hello LogSense" | nc -w 5 logs.logsense.com 32514
....

for instance:

....
$ echo "[10.1.2.3][aaabbbccc-0011-2233-4455-66778899ddee] Hello LogSense" | nc -w 5 logs.logsense.com 32514
....

That should produce `Hello LogSense` log for the specified IP address
which should be immediately visible in LogSense.
